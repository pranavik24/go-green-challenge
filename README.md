# Go Green! Challenge
Backyard Hacks 2022 Hackathon

## Inspiration
I was inspired by current efforts to encourage environmentally friendly habits, like recycling and cutting down on fuel consumption. But, I wanted to create a motivational way to do this! And what better way than encouraging a competition?

## What it does
This website encourages water bottle recycling by waging friendly competition among users.

## How we built it
I built the web application using Flask. To store data, I used SQLITE Database. I used HTML/CSS for the web pages.

## Challenges we ran into
There were a lot of new technologies that I used in this project, so time was especially an issue because there was a lot I needed to learn in such a short amount of time. Initially, I ran into issues with creating queries to access data from the database, but with some help, I was able to figure it out.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was the first time I built an application using Flask, so my constant determination while trying out this technology was one of my proudest accomplishments. I'm proud of the result I have produced.

## What we learned
I learned how to use many new technologies, especially Flask and SQLITE database.

## What's next for Go Green! Challenge
Putting it on a public platform to encourage users to use it. I also want to expand past just water bottles, hoping to combine several different ways people can help the environemnt- from reducing fuel consumption to stop food wastage.
